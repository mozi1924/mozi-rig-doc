**Introduction**  
This rigging system is specifically designed for Minecraft-style characters, delivering cinematic-level animation control capabilities. Featuring a modular skeletal structure and parametric control system, it enables comprehensive customization from basic movements to advanced facial performances. The system employs a non-destructive workflow where all functions support real-time adjustments, fully compatible with Blender 4.5+ versions.

The facial control system stands as my proudest achievement in rigging. It offers exceptional customizability with intuitive visualization, maintaining professional standards while prioritizing animator-friendly workflows. I firmly believe animators will find this model exceptionally satisfying to work with, as it allows them to focus their energy on performance artistry rather than wrestling with cumbersome controllers.
