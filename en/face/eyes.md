# Eye Controls  
This rig integrates two eye control methods: Classic and Tracker systems.  

## Classic Control  
The classic eye controller is the green frame located between the eyes on the facial panel.  

As shown:

Pupil controls support both rotation and scaling, producing distinct effects:

You can also click individual pupil frames for precise control:

## Tracker Controller  

True to its name, the Tracker controller enables pupils (and optionally the entire head) to follow gaze targets on the Tracker Pad. This system works concurrently with Classic controls - both can operate simultaneously.  

The Tracker controller shares partial operation logic with the Classic system:
