# Mouth Controls  

The mouth control operates inversely to most contemporary rigs - a historical legacy from my earliest rig design. However, you'll find its logic becomes intuitive with practice.  

## Main Controller  
Move the controller upward to open the mouth, downward to close:

Slide horizontally to adjust mouth width:

## Sub-Controllers  
The central yellow controllers manage lip corners:

Enable round_mouth in Properties Panel for automatic circular shaping without manual adjustment:

## Teeth Controllers  
Position teeth controllers (circled) vertically:

The Auto_Teeth property controls following strength with mouth center (red cube):  
- Min 0: No follow  
- Max 1: Full follow

## Advanced Mouth Shaping  
Directly manipulate mouth region squares for custom shapes:

## Extended Manipulation  
Rotate, move, or scale the blue wireframe around the mouth for enhanced expressions:
